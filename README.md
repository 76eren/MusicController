This program allows you to control spotify by pressing a button
A video of how the result> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2WPa8MRPSE



NOTE: I did commit a sin by using a server inbetween the Pi and my PC.

To do list:
- Get rid of the fucking server and make it work on LAN.
- Make program able to make the music louder/quieter by holding down the button
